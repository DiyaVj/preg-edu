            Doctor's Visits and Prenatal Care
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-section-paragraph">
            Regular prenatal care is essential for a healthy pregnancy. During
            these visits, your doctor will monitor your health and the
            development of the baby, and offer guidance on a variety of topics
            like nutrition, exercise, and childbirth preparation. Prenatal care
            typically involves a series of check-ups and tests, including blood
            tests, urine tests, and ultrasounds.

          <p class="blog-section-paragraph">
            Pregnancy tests are used to confirm pregnancy by detecting the
            presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the
            urine or blood. Ultrasounds can also be used to confirm pregnancy
            and check for any abnormalities in the developing fetus. During the
            first month, an ultrasound may not show much, but it can still be
            used to confirm pregnancy and estimate the due date.
